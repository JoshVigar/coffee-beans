# Coffee Beans

Coffee Beans is an opt in coffee break slack app.

Users can use the slash command `/coffee` in order to be placed into a queue for a coffee break. When the queue is full the paricipents will be placed into a group message together.

## Development

Coffee Beans is a dockerised application. In order to start use `docker-compose up`.

A bot token is required to use this application. Get one at [the slack api site](https://api.slack.com/apps). This should be added to an environment(.env) file.
